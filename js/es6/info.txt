ES6:
CREATED 3 CLASSES:
1. UI: with methods:
   i) addToCart
   ii) delete
   iii)calculateTotal
   iv) changeQuantity
   v) pay

2. ITEM: containing properties of item object: name, price and src

3. STORE: containing all local storage related methods defined.

___

*es6.js

    *Added event handlers and grabbed items to apply UI methods to.
    *stored all items in shop in an array ..itemsArray: with their respective ids.
    *used Find(x) to return the shopping item object selected.
    


*ISSUES:
1. cart shouldnt have duplicated items
2. appearance in mobile view

*WHAT I HAVE DONE
1. Updated the styles a bit to be more responsive on mobile

*OBSERVATIONS
1. You are depending on HTML to perform operations instead of your store data
2. You don't clear the store after the user buys
3. After adding to cart, no action shows that it was successful
4. Items should not just be gotten from HTML, you should declare a class with the default items and then read from there to HTML instead of having all the items defined on HTML
