ES6:
CREATED 3 CLASSES:
1. UI: with methods:
   i) addToCart
   ii) delete
   iii)calculateTotal
   iv) changeQuantity
   v) pay

2. ITEM: containing properties of item object: name, price and src

3. STORE: containing all local storage related methods defined.

___

*es6.js

    *Added event handlers and grabbed items to apply UI methods to.
    *stored all items in shop in json file ..with their respective properties.
    *used Find(x) to return the shopping item object selected in UI.
    


*ISSUES:
1. cart shouldnt have duplicated items
2. appearance in mobile view

************* DATE: 13TH JUNE, 2020 ************* 
*WHAT I HAVE DONE
1. Updated the styles a bit to be more responsive on mobile

*OBSERVATIONS
1. You are depending on HTML to perform operations instead of your store data
2. You don't clear the store after the user buys
3. After adding to cart, no action shows that it was successful
4. Items should not just be gotten from HTML, you should declare a class with the default items and then read from there to HTML instead of having all the items defined on HTML
5. create a button to clear cart

LATEST CORRECTIONS: (ME)
1.(done) Saved all Shop items in json file
2. (done) Item cards in html are now made dynamically. Items stored in JSON would be added to interface using ui.loadShopItems().
3.(issue) Add to card button adjusted to work on cards
    :(-- returns the item object as undefined in function and cart. Problem in ui.js line 62
4. Green "Add to card" button toggles to Red "ADDED" button to indicate when items are added;
    :(-- how to toggle back when item is deleted or cleared from cart? traversing? how to link the item in the cart to the card?
5. (issue) Added a clear cart button :(-- only deletes one item at a time. Whats wrong with for loop in es6.js line 49


notes:
1. json file must be in same dir level as index
2. using a functiom defined in the same class in another function must use 'this."
